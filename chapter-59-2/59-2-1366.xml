Apportionment of redemption or assignment money.
(1)
If property sold to the county under this title is redeemed, or the certificate of sale is assigned, the money received on account of the redemption or assignment shall be distributed as follows:
(a)
the original and subsequent taxes, and 40% of interest, penalty, and costs of sale received shall be apportioned to the taxing entities interested, in proportion to their respective taxes;
(b)
the original and subsequent tax notice charges, and 40% of interest, penalty, and costs of sale received shall be apportioned to the tax notice charge entities interested, in proportion to their respective tax notice charges; and
(c)
the balance shall be paid to the county.
(2)
If a sum less than the taxes, tax notice charges, interest, penalty, and costs is accepted in settlement, the proceeds of the settlement shall be applied, first to the payment of the original and subsequent taxes and tax notice charges, and the remainder, if any, to the payment of interest, penalty, and costs.
