Burden of proof -- Statutory construction.
(1)
In a proceeding before the commission, the burden of proof is on the petitioner except for determining the following, in which the burden of proof is on the commission:
(a)
whether the petitioner committed fraud with intent to evade a tax, fee, or charge;
(b)
whether the petitioner is obligated as the transferee of property of the person that originally owes a liability or a preceding transferee, but not to show that the person that originally owes a liability is obligated for the liability; and
(c)
whether the petitioner is liable for an increase in a deficiency if the increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency is mailed in accordance with Section
59-1-1405
and a petition under
Part 5, Petitions for Redetermination of Deficiencies
, is filed, unless the increase in the deficiency is the result of a change or correction of federal taxable income:
(i)
required to be reported; and
(ii)
of which the commission has no notice at the time the commission mails the notice of deficiency.
(2)
Regardless of whether a taxpayer has paid or remitted a tax, fee, or charge, the commission or a court considering a case involving the tax, fee, or charge shall:
(a)
construe a statute imposing the tax, fee, or charge strictly in favor of the taxpayer; and
(b)
construe a statute providing an exemption from or credit against the tax, fee, or charge strictly against the taxpayer.
