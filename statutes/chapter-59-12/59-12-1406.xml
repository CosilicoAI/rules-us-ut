(1)
Except as provided in Subsection
(2)

(a)
the certified service provider or model 2 seller relies on software the commission certifies; and
(b)
the certified service provider's or model 2 seller's failure to collect a tax required under this part is as a result of the seller's or certified service provider's reliance on incorrect data:

(ii)
in the software the commission certifies.
(2)
The relief from liability described in Subsection

If the taxability of a product category is incorrectly classified in software the commission certifies, the commission shall:
(a)
notify a certified service provider or model 2 seller of the incorrect classification of the taxability of a product category in software the commission certifies; and
(b)
state in the notice required by Subsection
(3)(a)
that the certified service provider or model 2 seller is liable for failing to collect the correct amount of tax under this part on the incorrectly classified product category if the certified service provider or model 2 seller fails to correct the taxability of the item or transaction within 10 days after the day on which the certified service provider or model 2 seller receives the notice.
(4)
If a certified service provider or model 2 seller fails to correct the taxability of an item or transaction within 10 days after the day on which the certified service provider or model 2 seller receives the notice described in Subsection
