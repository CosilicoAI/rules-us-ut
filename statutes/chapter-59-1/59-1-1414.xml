, the commission may:
(a)
file a warrant with the clerk of:
(i)
except as provided in Subsection
(1)(a)(ii)
, the district court of any county in which that person has real or personal property; or
(ii)
if the person is not a resident of this state, the Third District Court in Salt Lake City; or
(b)
issue a warrant in duplicate under its official seal directed to the sheriff of a county requiring the sheriff to:
(i)

(ii)
return to the commission within 60 days:
(A)
the warrant; and
(B)

(2)
(a)
A sheriff that receives a warrant under Subsection
(1)
shall within five days file a duplicate copy of the warrant with the clerk of the district court of the appropriate county.

(i)
The sheriff shall execute the warrant in the same manner prescribed by law for an execution issued against property in accordance with a judgment by a court.
(ii)
An execution of a warrant described in Subsection
(2)(b)(i)
has the same effect as an execution issued against property in accordance with a judgment by a court.
(iii)
A sheriff that executes a warrant under Subsection
(2)(b)(i)
shall receive fees for the sheriff's services in executing the warrant as if the sheriff were executing a judgment by a court.
(3)
The commission may file a warrant without regard to the 30-day period provided in Subsection

(4)
The commission may not file a warrant under this section more than three years after the assessment of the tax, fee, or charge that is a portion of a liability.

(b)
the commission determines that the person does not have sufficient real or personal property in the state to pay the person's liability.
