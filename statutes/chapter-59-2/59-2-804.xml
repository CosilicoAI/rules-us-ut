As used in this section:
(a)
&quot;Aircraft type&quot; means a particular model of aircraft as designated by the manufacturer of the aircraft.
(b)
&quot;Airline ground hours calculation&quot; means an amount equal to the product of:

the total number of hours aircraft owned or operated by an airline are on the ground, calculated by aircraft type; and
(ii)
the cost percentage.
(c)
&quot;Airline revenue ton miles&quot; means, for an airline, the total revenue ton miles during the calendar year that immediately precedes the January 1 described in Section
59-2-103
.
(d)
&quot;Cost percentage&quot; means a fraction, calculated by aircraft type, the numerator of which is the airline's average cost of the aircraft type and the denominator of which is the airline's average cost of the aircraft type:
(i)
owned or operated by the airline; and
(ii)
that has the lowest average cost.
(e)
&quot;Ground hours factor&quot; means the product of:
(i)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Utah ground hours calculation and the denominator of which is the airline ground hours calculation; and
(ii)
.50.
(f)
(i)
Except as provided in Subsection
(1)(f)(ii)
, &quot;mobile flight equipment&quot; is as defined in Section
59-2-102

air charter service; or
(B)
air contract service.
(g)
&quot;Mobile flight equipment allocation factor&quot; means the sum of:
(i)

(ii)
the revenue ton miles factor.
(h)
&quot;Revenue ton miles&quot; is determined in accordance with 14 C.F.R. Part 241.
(i)
&quot;Revenue ton miles factor&quot; means the product of:
(i)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Utah revenue ton miles and the denominator of which is the airline revenue ton miles; and
(ii)
.50.
(j)
&quot;Utah ground hours calculation&quot; means an amount equal to the product of:
(i)
the total number of hours aircraft owned or operated by an airline are on the ground in this state, calculated by aircraft type; and
(ii)
the cost percentage.
(k)
&quot;Utah revenue ton miles&quot; means, for an airline, the total revenue ton miles within the borders of this state:
