If an interested person applies to a county legislative body for an adjustment or deferral of taxes levied against property  located in the county, the county legislative body may accept a sum less than the full amount due, or defer the full amount due, where, in the judgment of the county legislative body, the best human interests and the interests of the state and the county are served.
(b)
Nothing in this section prohibits a county legislative body from granting a retroactive adjustment or deferral if the criteria established in this section are met.

The commission shall prepare blank forms for an application for an adjustment or deferral under this section.
(3)
(a)
A county legislative body may not grant a deferral without the written consent of the holder of any mortgage or trust deed outstanding on the property.
